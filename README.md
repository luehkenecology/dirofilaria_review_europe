# Dirofilaria immitis and D. repens in Europe: a systematic literature review on vectors, host range, and the spatial distribution in the 20th and 21st century

Dirofilaria immitis and D. repens are mosquito-borne nematodes with dogs as primary hosts, but other mammalian species including humans can be also infected. In the last century, circulation of both pathogens was predominantly restricted to Southern Europe. However, different studies indicated a potential establishment in Central, Eastern and Western parts of Europe as an increasing threat to animal and human health. 

We conducted a systematic literature review of publications reporting D. immitis and D. repens screening in mosquitoes and mammalian vertebrates in Europe. These data were used to analyse the range of vectors and hosts and for a comparison of the spatial distribution between the 20th and 21st century. 

Our findings suggest that D. immitis and D. repens are a growing health concern for animals and humans in Europe. Continuous globalisation and climate warming will probably lead to a further spread and increased circulation in the future. All data are hereby made available open access, which will enable further analysis in the future.
